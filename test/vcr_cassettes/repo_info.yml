        \r\n\r\nMy machine currently only has PostgreSQL installed but not MySQL,
        so this error makes sense. I took a look at the Gemfile, and I noticed that
        there are some flags to check for Travis setups in the database configuration:\r\n```ruby\r\n#
        Database Configuration\r\nunless ENV[''TRAVIS'']\r\n  gem ''activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter'',
        ''>= 1.3.0.rc1'', platform: :jruby\r\n  gem ''sqlite3'', platform: :ruby\r\nend\r\n\r\nif
        !ENV[''TRAVIS''] || ENV[''DB''] == ''mysql''\r\n  gem ''activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter'',
        ''>= 1.3.0.rc1'', :platform => :jruby\r\n  gem ''mysql2'', :platform => :ruby\r\nend\r\n\r\nif
        !ENV[''TRAVIS''] || ENV[''DB''] == ''postgresql''\r\n  gem ''activerecord-jdbcpostgresql-adapter'',
        ''>= 1.3.0.rc1'', :platform => :jruby\r\n  gem ''pg'', :platform => :ruby\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo
        what appears to be happening is that Bundler is trying to install the mysql
        gem then the pg gem since it''s not a Travis environment. I don''t have MySQL
        installed, so Bundler crashes since it can''t find what it needs for the mysql
        gem installation. If I comment out the mysql gem, everything runs like a champ.\r\n\r\nIs
        this a legitimate issue, is something missing in the documentation, and/or
        am I missing something (likely with Travis, I''ve never used it) for getting
        the dummy app up and running?  \r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/refinery/refinerycms/issues/2143","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/refinery/refinerycms/issues/2143/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/refinery/refinerycms/issues/2143/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/refinery/refinerycms/issues/2143/events","html_url":"https://github.com/refinery/refinerycms/issues/2143","id":10028618,"number":2143,"title":"Old
