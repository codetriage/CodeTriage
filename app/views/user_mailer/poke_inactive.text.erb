Hello <%= @user.github %>,

You signed up to make a difference by triaging issues in github, which is
great, but you didn't actually subscribe to any projects. To fix this just
click on a link below, sign in, then click on the giant "subscribe" button:

Help the repo with the most issues:
<%= @most_repo.full_name %> (<%= repo_url(@most_repo) %>)

Help a repo in need:
<%= @need_repo.full_name %> (<%= repo_url(@need_repo) %>)

Help a random repo:
<%= @random_repo.full_name %> (<%= repo_url(@random_repo) %>)

If you don't like any of those add your own repo (<%= new_repo_url %>), browse
existing repos (<%= root_url %>), or you can even subscribe to code triage
itself (<%=  File.join(root_url, "/codetriage/codetriage") %>).
The important part is that you pick something to triage, or you will get this
same email next week, maybe with different repos.

To unsubscribe entirely delete your account (<%= user_url(@user) %>) but don't
do that, subscribe to an issue above and do some good in the world. I believe
in you.
