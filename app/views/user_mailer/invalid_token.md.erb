Hello @<%= @user.github %>,

## What?

Your GitHub token for CodeTriage is returning a non-success status.

## Why?

This can happen if you've changed authentication credentials for GitHub or if you revoke API access.

In June of 2017 there was an API outage on GitHub that caused some tokens to falsely be cleared. As a result your account token may have been cleared accidentally. We are sorry for this and as a preventative measure we [hardened this token checking and clearing code](https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage/pull/560).

## How to fix?

It takes less than 30 seconds to fix this issue with your account.

- Please visit [CodeTriage](<%= root_url %>) then click "Log in". This will re-authorize your GitHub token. You may have to accept GitHub prompts.

That's it. If you're already logged in:

- Click "log out" first then, press "sign in".

If you do not reauthorize CodeTriage on GitHub you will continue to get this email asking you to re-authorize your token. This will happen until you follow these instructions, or the heat death of the universe. Which ever comes first.

## Why do you even need my token?

If we don't use authenticated API requests then we're limited to 5,000 API requests on GitHub. Not just for you, but total. When you authorize a token on CodeTriage we use that to pull data such as new issues. To put that number in perspective that's greater than the currently open issues on [kubernetes](https://www.codetriage.com/kubernetes/kubernetes).

By re-authorizing your token on CodeTriage, we can continue to bring you quality issues and documentation. Also you'll avoid getting this reminder email again.

## I already did but I'm still getting these bloody emails

If you've tried signing out and then in again, but are still getting these emails please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage/issues) and we can look into it.

## Is this a phishing attack?

You can [see the contents of this email in the open source CodeTriage repo](https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage/blob/master/app/views/user_mailer/invalid_token.md.erb). We only ever ask for permission [to view your email from GitHub](https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage/blob/master/config/initializers/devise.rb#L206), which we clearly already have. If you're still cautious (good for you), manually visit CodeTriage yourself and then log out and then log in.

If you're curious, you can see [where we send these emails out](https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage/blob/master/lib/tasks/schedule.rake#L47-L52).

## I don't wanna, you can't make me

If you intended to revoke access, and don't want to receive any more CodeTriage emails ever, please [remove your account](<%= token_delete_user_url(@user.account_delete_token) %>).
