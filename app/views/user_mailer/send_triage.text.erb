Hello <%= @user.github %>,

You signed up to help triage GitHub issues on <%= @repo.path %> (<%= @repo.github_url %>).
That's pretty awesome.

Triage Issue: <%= @repo.path %><%= "##{@issue.number}" if @issue.number %>

<%= @issue.title %> (<%= @issue.html_url %>)

Goals of Triage

* Help share the weight of maintaining a project
* Minimize un-needed issues
* Prevent stale issues
* Encourage productive communication
* Teach good citizenship
* To become a better coder

How To Triage?

First, carefully read over the issue, title, and description, if there are any
comments read over all the comments, carefully. If a member of this repo is
engaging actively there is no need to do anything, leaving a comment in the
issue would just add to the clutter.

If the issue hasn't been updated in awhile, or if no one has commented consider
the issue, if it is a bug try to reproduce it. If it is a pull request consider
what an alternate implementation might look like. If there is something you
don't understand about the issue and feel others will have that same question
please leave your question in the comments. Be as descriptive as possible.
Comments like "I don't understand this" are not helpful and counter productive.
A better comment might be "Can you help me understand a use case for this?".

If you can reproduce the issue or you believe it is a good pull request, add a
comment and say why you think that is. Try to stay positive while triaging
issues, ask questions before you :-1: something. If you do decide to :+1: or
:-1: on an issue, leave a comment as to why you feel that way. Issues are for
social coding, if you help someone make better issues, you're helping the
community.

If the issue goes stale, leave a comment asking if it is still a problem. If
you get no response for a number of days, you can leave another comment
suggesting to the repo owner that they should close the issue.


Go forth and make the world a better place
